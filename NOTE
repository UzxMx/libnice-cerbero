# Glossary

## Build tools

Build tools are tools that can help build library. They are executable. That is to say, 
those executables are dependent, anything else will not be dependent by the library to be
built. Some examples in those tools include m4, make, autoconf, pkg-config.

# Class Design

## SourceType

## BuildType

## Recipe

Recipe is inherited from FilesProvider, a subclass derived from SourceType, and 
a subclass derived from BuildType. The dynamic multi-inheritance is implemented
by using metaclass in python. As a result, the recipe object can fetch source 
codes from somewhere, can be built in a predefined way.

# Misc

## Environment variables in python's sub shells

Some programs may be influenced by the exported environment variables, such as the 
configure script. During the config loading stage, some common environment variables 
will be put in python os.env dict. When a shell is invoked, the os.env is copied into 
the new shell. I think those environment variables all have export attribute, so 
when execute a command in the shell, these variables can be exported into the new process.

## pkg-config

The build system use its own pkg-config utility, no mattter whether the host has 
pkg-config or not. PKG_CONFIG, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment 
variables are put in os.env in cerbero/config.py file (see do_set_env() method). 
The configure script will use pkg-config provided by the environment variables rather 
than the one in the host system.
